# PycadeSample

Sample code to put pygame through some of its paces. Not sure where this one goes
but for now it is largely empty.

Use pip install -r requirements.txt to restore the virtual environment.

To save:
pip freeze > requirements.txt 

Still not clear how to start a fresh clone (do I need to create a venv and then restore?) 

I will experiment shortly.
